# CSGRN
We developed a supervised deep learning framework called Cell-Specific Gene Regulatory Network based on Causal Graph Embedding  (CSGRN), which integrates graph embedding with conditional cell-specific networks (CCSN) to infer cell-specific gene regulatory relations from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.
